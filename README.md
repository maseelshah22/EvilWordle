# Evil Wordle

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.5.

## About 👾🧩📱
* Evil Wordle is a spinoff of the beloved NYT Wordle Game
* This version chooses a word - of unknown length - and users must guess the word without knowing the size or what words are in it
* For each guess, players will know if their attempt was shorter, longer, or the same length as the actual word
* They will also know how many letters from their guess was in the word and how many were in the correct positon, but NOT which letters

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
You may also need to set up a server in order to run the php file that generates the random word.
